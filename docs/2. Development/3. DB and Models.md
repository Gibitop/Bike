# Database and models

This template communicates with MongoDB using mongoose \
Make sure you've filled in DB related fields in your .env file (see [Enviroment](../1.%20general/1.%20Enviroment.md)) \
DB configuration happens inside [mogoose.ts](../../src/lib/mongoose.ts) file

## Models:
Template uses mongoose'es models to comunicate with DB. When [defining a model](#create-a-new-model) you will want to fill in an interface and a model object. You fill them with basically the same information, but in sligtly different form. See [User](../../src/models/User.ts) model as example

### Create a new model:
Run one of the following:
- `yarn mkmodel <model name>`
- `npm run mkmodel <model name>`
- `node scripts/mkmodel.js <model name>`

This will generate a template of a model in `src/models` direcotry
