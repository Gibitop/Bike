# Cron jobs

Jobs are functions that run periodically. Periods are defined using `cron time string` format. You can use
[this website](https://crontab.guru/#0_0_*_*_1) to help understand the format.

Mind that `cron` npm package (which is used to handle cron jobs in this project) supports both standard and extended
(with one more field for seconds) time string formats

Jobs are stored in `src/jobs` directory. To start the job you will need to import it and call `start()` on the imported
job object.

## Create a new cron job

Run one of the following:

- `yarn mkjob <job name>`
- `npm run mkjob <job name>`
- `node scripts/mkjob.js <job name>`

This will generate a template of a job in `src/jobs` directory \
Don't forget to start your job
