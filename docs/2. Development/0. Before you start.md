# Before you start

## Let's make this repository your own:

1. Delete `.git` directory if it exists
2. Initialize your own repository (eg. `git init`)
3. Set package name inside [package.json](../../package.json) to the name of your project
4. Set package version inside [package.json](../../package.json) to your project's version
5. Check package's `private` variable inside [package.json](../../package.json)
5. Check package's `licence` variable inside [package.json](../../package.json)
6. Check code style rules in [.eslint.js](../../.eslintrc.js)
7. **If you are using NPM**, remove [yarn.lock](../../yarn.lock) file
8. Delete this file. It's no longer needed and will only confuse newcomers

This project is now yours. You are ready to start developing. \
Have fun :)
