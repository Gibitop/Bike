# Development commands

Here are some useful commands during development


## Compile and start:
You can use one of the following:
- `yarn bns`
- `npm run bns`

to compile and run the application with one command \
*(On windows only works with `powershell 7 preview 5+` or under `WSL`)*


## Fromating and style:
To format your code, use one of the following:
- `yarn reformat`
- `npm run reformat`
- `node_modules/.bin/eslint . --fix` 

*(Dev dependencies need to be installed. They are installed automatically when installing as shown [here](#dependecies))*
